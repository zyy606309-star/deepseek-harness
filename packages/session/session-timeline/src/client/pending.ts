/**
 * Pure pending-message matching: pairs the rendered pending-steering bubble
 * rows with the session's transient queue mirror rows (`placement === 'steering'`).
 *
 * Both sides derive from the host's next-step inbox order — the ChatView
 * renders `pendingSteering` in array order and the queue mirror keeps the same
 * host order — so index-primary matching is reliable. Text equality is still
 * verified as a per-row cross-check, and a row that fails (or a row with no
 * mirror item, or a mirror item with no row) is skipped INDIVIDUALLY: one bad
 * row never takes down the other rows' buttons. The matching text is the
 * bubble's message text WITHOUT its actions container — the harness copy
 * button's Tooltip mounts a label bubble inside that container on hover, so
 * the full row textContent would flip between "message" and "message+Copy"
 * with the mouse, flickering the button (see `bubbleTextOf` in portals.tsx).
 *
 * The browser half lives in `portals.tsx`; this module stays DOM-free so the
 * matching contract is unit-testable in a plain node environment.
